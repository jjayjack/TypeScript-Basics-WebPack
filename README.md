# TypeScript-Basics-WebPack

## About

You get the best of both worlds! Disadvantage of using ES Modules is that you are using loads of get requests which takes time to run request and send it to the page.
[WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/) is a tool that using [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) bundles files together. This tools allows larger packages of code to be bundled together with less imports required and let's us run a smoother application without a heavy coded application. WebPack allows us to plug in functionality to an application. It allows us to transform our code.

## To Begin

Install dependencies for development:
ts-loader
typescript
webpack
webpack-cli
webpack-dev-server

## Working within webpack.config.js

Working with the webpack configure JavaScript file sets up where Webpack must run and get correct paths to files.
